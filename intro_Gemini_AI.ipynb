            "*   **Model:** An LLM is a statistical model. It learns probabilities and relationships between words and phrases from the data it is trained on.  This allows it to predict what word or phrase is most likely to come next in a given context.\n",

            "\n",
            "1.  **Training:** The model is fed an enormous dataset of text (e.g., books, articles, websites, code).  During training, it learns to predict the next word in a sequence, given the preceding words. It adjusts its internal parameters to improve its predictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Inference:** Once trained, the model can be used to generate new text or perform other language-related tasks. You provide it with a prompt or input, and it uses its learned knowledge to produce an output.  For example, if you give it the prompt \"The capital of France is,\" it might generate the text \"Paris.\"\n",
